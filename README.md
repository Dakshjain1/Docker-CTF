# Docker-CTF
This will help you host a container running a CTF-Capture The Flag event using just one click in just 1 second

This is my project using docker software.
My idea is simple: Launch the CTF events on docker container for smooth management and hastle free server setup.

REQUIREMENTS
1. Any Linux Distro : I have used RHEL8
2. Docker software: I have server version 18.09.1
3. Docker-compose (because it doesn't come pre-installed with docker)
